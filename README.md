<b>Multi-Column-Notes</b>

Contains custom viewgroup implementation of multi-columned layout with variable height elements. The element is a custom text view. The Custom text view arranges its text size so that a minimum height is associated with the view and a maximum height so that an element is not spanned across many rows. The number of columns can be arranged by changing the parameter in the custom layout file. Also Contains Google Card UI. The Custom text view adjusts its height itself and the initial default height is calculated using a default text size and its resized based on the height of the element. The text resize is also done in such a way to protect the integrity of the word. If the word can be preserved by shifting to the next line, then it is done.<br>
